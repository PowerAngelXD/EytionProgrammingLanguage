Eytionlang is a lightweight interpretation language. Its syntax is as follows:
> primExpr->Number|(addExpr);  
> mulExpr->primExpr (mulOperator primExpr)*  
> mulOperator-> "*"|"/"|"%""  
> addExpr->mulExpr (addOperator mulExpr)*  
> addOperator->"+"|"-""  
>   
> stmt->outStmt  
> stat->stmt*  
> 
> OutStmt->"out" addExpr ";"  
> VorcStmt->("var"|"const)" "<"type">"iden "=" (value | value_expr) ";"  
> AssignStmt->iden "=" (value | value_expr) ";"  
> DeleteStmt->"delete" iden ";"  
> BlockStmt->"{" stmts "}"  

More syntax is waiting for subsequent updates
